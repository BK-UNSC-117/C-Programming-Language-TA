Poetry elevates each single thing through a particular combination with the rest of the whole. And while philosophy prepares the world for the active influence of ideas, poetry is the key to philosophy â€“ to its purpose and meaning. Because poetry shapes the beautiful society, the world-family, the beautiful home of the universe.
Philosophy strengthens the powers of the individual with the powers of humanity and the universe, through system and state, making the whole the instrument of the individual, and the individual the instrument of the whole. In the same way, poetry functions regarding life: The individual lives in the whole and the whole in the individual. Through poetry there arises the highest sympathy and common activity, the most intimate communion of the finite and the infinite.
